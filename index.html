                <p>
                    Hello, my name is Kelsey Selvaggi. I am 25 years old and I'm from a town called Doylestown in the suburbs of Philadelphia. I have recently began the journey to becoming a software engineer but that has not always been my goal. In High School, 
                    I never really knew what I wanted to do as a career but I was interested in math and science, leading me to start college at the University of Delaware as a Chemistry major. Four years later, I graduated with a Bachelor's in Biochemistry and
                    I began working as a lab tech in a microbiology lab called Charles River in 2019. During the pandemic, I really started to reconsider a lot of things about my life and what I wanted. During this time, I realized I was trans and eventually began the
                    process of transitioning. I also realized that my real passion and interest was computers and that I wanted to learn how to build software. This interest started from my early love of video games and I would love to sometime in the future 
                    maybe get into game development but for now I'm just looking to start a career in software development. Anyway, that's about it, check out the other sections for info on my interests and whatnot.

                <h1>My Interests and Hobbies</h1>
                <p>
                    I'll be honest, I don't really do that much. One of my favorite activities is listening to music and playing video games. I've recently been mostly playing Valorant and Elden Ring as well as a couple of indie games. I'm a big fan of rouge-likes.
                    I played a lot of Runescape as a kid and I've gone back to it a few times but I don't currently play. As far as music goes, I like a little bit of everything and what I like the most changes from time to time. I was just on a big trip-hop kick,
                    so I've been listening to a lot of Portishead and Massive Attack. Right now, my playlist consists of those two artsits, Rina Sawayama, Jockstrap, The Garden, and Bjork.
